# Testing Document

So far, nigh all the methods outside a few which were added recently during the week 4 sprint have working tests. This means that the Level-class and the new GUIController-class are the only classes without 100% working tests.

## Optimization

The code has only received very superficial optimization. No new feature will be added after next week's sprint, which means it will be a favourable time to optimize the features.

## Random Generation Algorithms

When both binary space partitioning and drunken crawl have been implemented, extra focus will be spent attempting to optimize these crucial algorithms.
