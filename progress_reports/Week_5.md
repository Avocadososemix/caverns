# Week 5

I started this week by fixing the mess that last weeks left for me. I had reached a state where everything worked, but was implemented at a threadbares level, so the last few hours were spent moving all the program logic to work now inside the working GUI. Then the addition of some optimization, removal of unnecessary code and imports. New javadoc where it was necessary. Testing the currently working GUI, and adding a feature for the GUI to show messages to the user concerning his/her actions on the level.  

The next logical step would be to add the binary space partitioning algorithm to the program and implement its use on map generation.
