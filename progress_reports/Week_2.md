# Week 2

The week started with massive problems, I had never really made a gradle-project of my own, and could not figure out how to make the packages and gradle.build file work as I wanted. What should have been a relatively simple thing turned into a big time sink.

After the initial troubles had passed, programming could start in earnest. Initially a quick mock-up of the final map data-structure was made using a Level-object, which had embedded tile object for each tile available on the map. Tiles are represented using ascii characters. Different tiles can be given different properties. A fast and dirty way to look at the prelimanary version of the map was added as well.
