# Week 4

This week started with writing the tests that were sorely lacking from my project. I had attempted to use a newer version of jUnit and gradle, that were not cooperating, so I reverted my build.gradle file to an earlier version where I had yet to tamper with it excessively.


## JUnit tests

Spent a long time writing my neglected jUnit tests. This was a great learning experience which I should have focused on earlier. Learning that I can create new input streams for print methods was a good experience, as well using it in a constructive way. Altogether, writing tests took the better part of a long afternoon.
