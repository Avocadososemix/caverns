# Week 1

Most of my time was spent on deciding a topic for the project. After several days of consideration, developing a generator for random caverns/dungeons appealed to me the most.  

I spent many hours poring through websites and articles concerned with roguelike map design and generation, and decided to focus my attention to two different algorithms that would provide very different effects in the creation of randomly generated caverns. The *drunken walk* algorithm allows the generation of cavernous shapes and the *binary space partition* algorithm would find its use in generating more room-like map-types.  

Programming-wise the application has only been recently pushed to github, and true development will start next week.  

This week I spent 4 hours setting up the project, and several more deciding the topic of the project.  

## Goals for Next Week

My goals/sprints for next week are:  

1. Plan how to represent map in program memory.
2. Generate some kind of gui through which the map can be perceived
3. Add a scrolling feature to the map
4. Add a player character that moves on the map, with the map being centered on the player character.

If time permits, create a system for passable/unpassable tiles.
