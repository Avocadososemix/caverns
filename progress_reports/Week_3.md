# Week 3

This week started with adding player movement to the build. The biggest problem encountered was with the Scanner-method that is included in the JDK-8, as it didn't work with gradle without adding a line to the build.gradle file. Later I implemented walls and other obstacles blocking player movement. These tasks took around 2 hours of work on seperate days. I also spent some time thinking on how to get rid of the arraylists that I employ in the project currently.
